# Introduction

Celestial is a starter template for Wordpress. It is based on the [Sage 10](https://roots.io/sage/) starter theme and additional packages for Sage such as:

* Poet ([https://github.com/Log1x/poet](https://github.com/Log1x/poet))
* ACF Composer ([https://github.com/Log1x/acf-composer](https://github.com/Log1x/acf-composer))
* Ignition ([https://github.com/spatie/laravel-ignition](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-ignition))
* Navi ([https://github.com/Log1x/navi](https://github.com/Log1x/navi))
* Sage SVG ([https://github.com/Log1x/sage-svg](https://github.com/Log1x/sage-svg))

Sage 10 used:

* Harness the power of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and its available packages thanks to [Acorn](https://github.com/roots/acorn).
* Clean, efficient theme templating utilizing [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade).
* Lightning fast frontend development workflow powered by [Bud](https://bud.js.org/).
* Out of the box support for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Celestial is more of a methodology for working with Sage 10 and its packages. To get all the benefits from Celestial, strictly adhere to all the rules in the documentation to get the most structured project possible.
